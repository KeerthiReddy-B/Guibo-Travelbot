# Guibo Project Capstone

Hi, I’m Keerthi Reddy Bokka 👋  

I built this capstone project as part of my learning journey and out of pure **passion for Generative AI and Data Science**.  
For me, projects like this are an opportunity to push boundaries, explore data deeply, and prepare for building next-generation AI-powered solutions.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This notebook represents my hands-on exploration of data:
- **Cleaning and preprocessing** raw data to make it usable
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover hidden patterns
- **Visualizations** that bring insights to life
- **Feature engineering and modeling** to solve real-world problems
- **Actionable insights** that connect technical work to business value

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
I leveraged tools that I use in professional AI/ML projects:
- **Python, Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for ML workflows (where applicable)

---

## 💡 Why I Did This
I am deeply passionate about **Generative AI and advanced analytics**.  
This project was a way for me to strengthen my foundations in:
- Understanding how structured workflows evolve from raw data to insights
- Thinking about how classical ML and analytics can be extended into **RAG pipelines and GenAI-powered systems**
- Practicing the discipline of making projects not just functional, but **clear, reproducible, and impactful**

## 📊 Results / Key Insights
- Structured data into meaningful features for analysis
- Uncovered trends that could drive decisions
- Built a repeatable workflow to expand into more advanced AI solutions
