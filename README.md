# Guibo Project Capstone

Hi, I’m Keerthi Reddy Bokka 👋  

Guibo is a Travel Assistant Bot designed to help users plan trips, explore destinations, and get personalized recommendations. I built it as a capstone project to combine my passion for AI/ML with a real-world use case that touches millions of people globally.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This notebook represents my hands-on exploration of data:
- **Cleaning and preprocessing** raw data to make it usable
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover hidden patterns
- **Visualizations** that bring insights to life
- **Feature engineering and modeling** to solve real-world problems
- **Actionable insights** that connect technical work to business value

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
I leveraged tools that I use in professional AI/ML projects:
- **Python, Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for ML workflows (where applicable)

## 🌟 Why It Matters
- Demonstrates how **AI + NLP + GenAI** can go beyond research and directly solve user problems.  
- Highlights my ability to build **applied AI systems** that combine data analysis with conversational interfaces.  
- Travel is a universal domain — this project shows how AI can make everyday experiences like trip planning **faster, smarter, and more engaging**.
